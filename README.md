- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JaeCrainix
- Crainix is a nonprofit that does positive education and other projects for Brain Health.
- We are currently working on "Understanding Algebra and Caclulus" which is a math curriculum for adult, young, and twice-exceptional students. 
- We are adding an option to show what you know by coding in python. 
- Anyone interested in collaborating, using the curriculum, or participating as a student are welcome to email crainix@outlook.com 
and include enough info or "UAC" in the subject so that we know it is not spam.
